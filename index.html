            <p class="text">Amanda is a loveable ever smiling medical officer that was diagnosed with avascular necrosis of the right femoral head and has since battled with this disease for over 10 years.
                The condition deteriorated, causing her constant pain and reduced ability and so she opted for a hip replacement surgery in June 2023. 
                <br> However, weeks after the surgery, she needed to have a corrective surgery as a result of some complications.Yet after the 2nd surgery, Amanda has been in pain and left worse off than when she decided to have the first surgery.
                A second opinion was gotten from (National Orthopedic Hospital, Lagos- name in full) and yet again she's been told that she would be needing a revision surgery running to about 3 million naira, this includes cost of surgery, prosthesis, hospital stay, investigations and other logistics.
                <br> Throughout this period, Amanda's family have been there for her and are still there for her. However, the cost of her getting a chance at being able to use her legs again have become overwhelming.
                This is a call for your financial support, every amount will be greatly appreciated as you'd be helping her overcome the pain she has had to deal with over time.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you and God bless you
